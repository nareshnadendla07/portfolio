# 🧠 Real-World AI + Automation Portfolio

Welcome! I'm building 10 real-time, problem-solving projects that combine cloud, AI, and automation — designed not just for technical demonstration, but for real financial, legal, and planning use cases.

### 🔍 Focus Areas
- AI Infrastructure & Cloud Automation (AWS, Azure, Terraform)
- Financial Planning, Forecasting & Retirement Tools
- GPT-Powered Assistants (Legal, Tax, Strategy)
- Data & Sentiment Dashboards
- Subdivision & Real Estate AI Planning
- Self-Learning SaaS Concepts

Each project is:
- Fully open source (or with clean core logic)
- Built to solve a **real-world pain point**
- Continuously improved based on real feedback
