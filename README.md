# 🧠 Real-World AI + Automation Portfolio

Welcome! I'm building 10 real-time, problem-solving projects that combine cloud, AI, and automation — designed not just for technical demonstration, but for real financial, legal, and planning use cases.

### 🔍 Focus Areas
- AI Infrastructure & Cloud Automation (AWS, Azure, Terraform)
- Financial Planning, Forecasting & Retirement Tools
- GPT-Powered Assistants (Legal, Tax, Strategy)
- Data & Sentiment Dashboards
- Subdivision & Real Estate AI Planning
- Self-Learning SaaS Concepts

 Code for most projects is **not publicly available** as they are intended for commercial use, passive income generation, or private consulting. However, each entry includes:
- Overview of what the tool does
- Tech stack & architecture
- Live demo link or screenshots (where applicable)
- Built to solve a **real-world pain point**
- Continuously improved based on real feedback
